          Music is a main interest of mine, and I often go to gigs and festivals. Iâ€™ve been playing guitar since I was 11 years old, and am currently involved in a couple of bands, which has led
          to performing in pubs and clubs around Manchester. I'm also a huge Man United fan and will go and watch them
          when they play at home.
