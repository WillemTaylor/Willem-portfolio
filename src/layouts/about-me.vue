          I'm a hard working developer who is highly motivated, creative,
          reliable and who can work well independently or as part of a team. My
          current role in Ocean Finance has given valuable experience of
          delivering industry leading web applications in an E-Commerce
          environment, as well as carrying out projects to strict deadlines,
          working in a high-pressured and fast paced environment and gaining a
          strong knowledge in various tech stacks.

          Music is a main interest of mine, and I often go to gigs and festivals. Iâ€™ve been playing guitar for
          14 years and am currently involved in a couple of bands, which has led
          to performing in pubs and clubs around Manchester. As well as this,
          i've also created our

          too. I'm also an avid Man United fan and will go and watch them
          when they play at home.
