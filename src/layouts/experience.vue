        <p>
          Before this, I enrolled onto a 12 week Full-stack coding bootcamp
          (Northcoder's). Before this course, I was learning to code online via
          Code Academy, Free code camp, Codewars, etc. Northcoder's is where I
          was able to hone my new skills and engrain this new knowledge into
          real projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          These projects included 'NC-News': A fully responsive Fullstack,
          Reddit-style news board where users can vote and comment on different
          articles. A RESTful API built with Node.js, SQL, Express.js and
          front-end built in React.js. There was also 'CryptoVox': An audio
          encryption/decryption file sharing site, within a workspace dashboard.
          The back-end was built as a RESTful API with Flask, SQL and front-end
          built in React.JS. The language was written in Python due to the
          extensive cryptography libraries available.
